This chapter is dedicated to the project schedule. For each part of the project we report in a table the deadline, (not necessarily) a probably initial date, the description and the division among the team member (who are the authors of this document), identified by the following characters: \textquoteleft \textbf{L}\textquoteright\ for Luca Luciano Costanzo and \textquoteleft \textbf{S}\textquoteright\ for Simone Disabato.\\
To clarify the deadlines, we suppose that we have at our disposal about 20-25 hours per week to work at the project development\footnote{Note that the value 25 hours per week is the same used in the \autoref{ProjectEstimation:EffortEstimation} to calculate the required person-month.}.\\
