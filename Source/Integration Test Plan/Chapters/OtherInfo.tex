\section{Changes (w.r.t. version 1.0)}
In this release two changes have been made to correct a few errors: first of all, in the \autoref{ToolsAndTestEquipmentRequired} we have added a footnote to clarify that the project has not been thought for a particular development platform.\\
Second, a section has been re-written to make it more coherent w.r.t. the whole document.
