In this chapter the most interesting algorithm of myTaxiService are presented using pseudo-code (every developer can easily translate the pseudo-code into the desired programming language).\\
The meaning of word \textit{interesting}, used above to define the algorithms which we are presenting, is the following: a characteristic and unique algorithm, used to implement some specific functionalities of this system. For instance, an algorithm to manage the backup of the database can be very complicated in describing the policies, the exceptions and the situations when execute its, but it is a common algorithm to all the systems that store data into a database.\\
In this chapter the algorithms analysed are the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item the city's areas creations and management;
	\item the queue's management;
	\item all the algorithms used to handle the special situation which occur when no cabmen are available in the area where the ride (which the Ride Allocator is no assigning) starting position is.
\end{itemize}
