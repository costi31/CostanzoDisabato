In this chapter are shown the main \glspl{mockup} of myTaxiService, due to present the graphical user interfaces of the system for each functionality. All the \glspl{mockup} are displayed with an accurate description to prevent misunderstanding and to recall the functionality.\\

\section{Registration/Login}
When an user connects to the WS or opens the MA, the first screens is the login page. For both the versions, there is a button to redirect to the registration page, if the user is not registered yet.\\
The figure \ref{UI:loginWS} is the WS version where the registration button is made by a link on the phrase \textquotedblleft Not Registered yet? Click here\textquotedblright. At the same time the user can insert his credentials into the specific boxes.\\
The figure \ref{UI:loginMA} is the corresponding \gls{mockup} for the mobile application: at the application opening the user can inserts his credentials or clicks on the registration button.\\

A non registered user has to enrol into the system, so he clicks on the corresponding button and he is redirected to that page. The figures \ref{UI:registrationWS} and \ref{UI:registrationMA} shows the \glspl{mockup} for this: into the \gls{ma} the box labels are written into them and disappears when the user fills in; into the \gls{ws} the labels are shown near the corresponding one.\\
